# You will write two methods:

# You will write a method is_prime? that takes in a number
# This method returns a boolean, indicating whether the number is prime. 
# Note: A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

# The method pick_primes that takes in an array of numbers
# The method should return a new array containing only the prime numbers
# The method pick_primes should use the method is_prime?

def is_prime?(num)
    # Write your code here

def pick_primes(numbers)
    # Write your code here
