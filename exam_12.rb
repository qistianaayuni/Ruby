# You will write a method, caesar_cipher that takes a String
# The method will shift the characters by an Integer factor and then output the modified String
# For example, caesar_cipher("a", 5) -> "f"
# (a is the first alphabet (1). Add 5, so the value is now 6. f is the 6th alphabet.)
# Remember that lowercase and uppercase characters have different values
